Chosen-ciphertext secure proxy re-encryption.
In Proceedings of the 2007 ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, (CCSâ€™07),

Properties:
- CCA-secure
- bidirectional (a re-encryption key from Alice to Bob also permits
  re-encryptino from Bob to Alice)
- multihop (a ciphertext may be re-encrypted multiple times---from Alice to Bob
  to Carol, etc.)
